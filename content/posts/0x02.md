## Moving forward

It's been a week of reading about _Hugo_, its templating system, all these _partials_ and so on, and you know what? I don't need to know anything about the internals. All the essentials are: read the _quick start guide_ for _Hugo_ in general, and then, read how to use your theme. In my case it was _hugo book_.

<!--more-->

The thing is: _don't overthink_! Just create your new website, add theme and use it. Here's how you do it:

* create new site as usual,
* install `book` theme as git submodule:

```sh
git submodule add https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book themes/hugo-book
```

* use theme in your `hugo.toml` file:

```toml
theme = "hugo-book"
```

* create new posts in `content/posts`
* **create new docs** in `content/docs` -- that saves a lot of reading when you for instance want to do a menu in sidebar based on site content
* keep the structure more or less like the following (note `_index.md` in parents):

```bash
content
├── docs
│   ├── clouds
│   ├── containers
│   ├── databases
│   ├── games
│   │   └── _index..md
│   ├── hardware
│   ├── links.md
│   ├── programming
│   │   ├── _index.md
│   │   ├── go
│   │   │   └── _index.md
│   │   ├── python
│   │   │   └── _index.md
│   │   ├── scripting
│   │   │   └── powershell.md
│   │   ├── webservices
│   │   │   ├── _index.md
```
* remember about `weight` in page front matter to have the menu ordered as you like:
```md
weight = 1
```
* remember about `menu` in page front matter:
```md
menus = 'main'
```

Typical front matter:
```md
+++
date = '2025-09-04T17:13:23+02:00'
title = 'Software Tools'
menus = 'main'
type = 'page'
+++
```

_Hugo_ and _Book theme_ will take care of the rest.

### Tweaking the theme

_Book theme_ by default does not show any `read more` link.

Here's how you change it:

* copy file to `themes/hugo-book/layouts/posts/lists.html` to i`layouts/posts/list.html`
* add `read more` pretty much like the following, after `Summary`:

```html
    <div class="book-post-content">
      {{- .Summary -}}
      <p><a href="{{ .RelPermalink }}">(read more...)</a></p>
    </div>
```

Don't hesitate to change it as you like.

## Next?

Next couple of days I'm going to move all my content from bookmarks, Google Notes and other places here, into [Links](/docs/links)
